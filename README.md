Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the art and science of designing, building and maintaining software products (solution) in order to produce high-quality software that is reliable and solves real-world problems.
Software engineering is important in technology industry cause it enables the creation of software applications and systems that powers various aspects the modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming language(fortran).
Rise of Agile methodologies in 2000s and in 1960, software engineer was established as a discipline.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement: collection of documents for user needs and system requirements. 
Design: involves the design of a high quality software.
Implementation: this phase involves writing codes and building software according to design.
Testing: various tests are carried out in this phase to ensure the quality standards and functions required.
Deployment: here, the software is released to the users.
Maintenance: this involves the update, support and enhancement of the software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear sequential (rigid) approach flowing downward like waterfall while Agile methodologies is iterative and flexible focused on collaboration.
E.g. Waterfall is applicable to a construction project and Agile is applicable to software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: responsible for writing codes and implementation of software solutions.
Quality Assurance: Ensures software quality by designing and conducting various tests.
Project Manager: responsible for making decisions as regards software to be built.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs is a software application that allows developers to write, compile, test, and debug code in a comprehensive manner. E.g. NetBeans, Eclipse.
VCS is a tool that helps manage changes to code, documents etc. E.g. Subversion, Git and Perforce.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadline, Changing requirements and technical debt.
It can be overcome through team work, collaboration and communication.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Testing helps to ensure standard quality and function requirement of software.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is defined as a task or instruction given in form of command or a question to AI in order to get a possible solution or response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Explain climate change.
Give a comprehensive explanation of the concept of climate change.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear, specific and concise and would generate a substantial and comprehensive response.
